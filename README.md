# Overview

This is the repository for: ‘Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients
outperform embeddings from pre-trained convolutional neural networks
under noisy conditions for discrimination tasks of individual gibbons’
(Lakdari et al, under review). The goal of the paper is to compare
different approaches of feature extraction for individual discrimination
of gibbon female calls. Acoustic data can be downloaded at:
10.5281/zenodo.8205685.

Analyses were done in both R and Python.

## Feature/embedding extraction

### MFCCs

### BirdNET

### VGGish
