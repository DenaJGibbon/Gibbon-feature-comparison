# Overview
This is the repository for: 'Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients outperform embeddings from pre-trained convolutional neural networks under noisy conditions for discrimination tasks of individual gibbons' (Lakdari et al, under review). The goal of the paper is to compare different approaches of feature extraction for individual discrimination of gibbon female calls. Acoustic data can be downloaded at: 10.5281/zenodo.8205685. 

Feature extraction was done in both R and Python, and analyses for publication were done in R.
